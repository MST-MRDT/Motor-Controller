Ask Jacob if we want to run 2 PVDD inputs for each moco so that we have sperate power running to each phase

**Design Ideas
	LEDIndication for Each motor phase (Physically see what's firing)
	
Annotate schematic and assign footprints

Consider using bus fr SH_A since youre already using it fo sense

Headers need to be shifted to the right by some amount to mitigate the overhang of the f28069m. Look at the datasheet to determine the amount of space to move the headers.

Calculate resistor value to put pack voltage directly to LED after removing transistor

Run two LEDS through GH and GL through a 1K ohm resistor for each phase of each motor, leave it indicators for neatness

Add LEDs for Serial TX and RX

For PDR:

Pin table based on motor header connections

Make a folder in the PDR folder for this board and upload the documentation there and on github (PDFs or txt files)

List of changes from Cameron's system. I'll talk about the hardware changes and Andrew will talk about the software changes
