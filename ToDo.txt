**IMPORTANT**
	Motor Headers, you used TM4C123G. You need to use F280609m
	Net "232_TX_M1 is not routed to anything
	

Consider runningNOCTW and NFAULT buss directly into LED instead of through FET
Consider labeling the andersons in external connections. (Perhaps group them more tightly too)
Ask Jacob if we want to run 2 PVDD inputs for each moco so that we have sperate power running to each phase
Max 3232 could be moved to its own section
Do we need that many GND testpoints?

**Design Ideas
	LEDIndication for Each motor phase (Physically see what's firing)
	

Annotate schematic and assign footprints

Consider using bus fr SH_A since youre already using it fo sense
